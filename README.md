This a project that I undertook at the end of my apprenticeship which I got a distinction in. I allows user to log in and then upload media files to the system so then they can play them. The system also allows the user to sort the files into a playlist, add and remove categories to the file, delete files, delete playlists, search and sort files in the playlist and also in the file management.

Skills Learned:-
- AJAX in vanilla javascript
- OOP PHP
- file upload in PHP
- SQL joins
- SQL indexing
